My portfolio consists of a main web page "index.html", whcih contains links to a short bio "bio.html" and my resume "resume.html".

This is implemented by 3 html documents and 1 CSS document. The CSS document "page.css" defines the structure of the page for viewing on a desktop.

So far, only HTML and CSS was used to build this web page. HTML was used to define the content of the page and CSS was used to set its structure and presentation. No front-end framework was used.

I spent around 4-5 hours working on the lab. It was tricky to figure out how to access git from Terminal and to upload files from my local repository at first.
