My portfolio consists of a main web page "index.html", whcih contains links to a short bio "bio.html" and my resume "resume.html".

This is implemented by 3 html documents and 1 CSS document. The CSS document "page.css" defines the structure of the page for viewing on a desktop.

I spent around 3-4 hours working on the lab. It was tricky to figure out how to access git from Terminal and to upload files from my local repository at first.
