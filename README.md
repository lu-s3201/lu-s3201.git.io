# lu-s3201.git.io

This project implements 3 web pages. This is done by 3 html documents ("resume.html", "bio.html" and "index.html")and one CSS document. The CSS document "page.css" defines the structure of the page for desktop use.

I spent around 3-4 hours working on the lab. It was tricky to figure out how to access git from Terminal and upload files from my local repository at first.
