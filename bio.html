        <p>
            I spent my childhood in Asia. I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and lived there until I was 6 years old. After that, I moved to Shanghai, China for 3 years. I spent most of my life in Singapore, which is the place that may family and I really call home. After high school, I relocated to Boston to attend Tufts. I'm now a rising sophomore there.

            I feel that I always need to have a creative outlet. I love creating things - making artwork, playing music, baking deserts, cooking meals, anything that would leave me with a product I'm proud of after a long day of effort. I feel that this is a reason why I enjoy learning CS and using that knowledge to build projects.
