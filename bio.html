        <p>
            I spent my childhood in Asia. I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and lived there until I was 6 years old. I also lived in Shanghai, China for 3 years, and then moved to Singapore. There, I spent most of my life. For university, I moved to Boston to attend Tufts. I'm now a rising sophomore there.

            I feel that I always need to have a creative outlet. I love creating things - making artwork, playing music, baking deserts, cooking meals, anything that would leave me with a product I'm proud of after a long day of effort.
